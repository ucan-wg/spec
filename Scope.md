# Scope

This document specifies a chained authorization certificate format. It is applicable to capability-based authorization and cryptographic challenge-responses for networked, peer-to-peer, Cloud, offline, local-first, cross-application, and blockchain use cases where capabilities need to be shared between principals without transmitting private key material.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
